# Java Learning Journey — Advanced 

This repository contains my daily progress as I learn Java from scratch. It includes hands-on code, practice exercises, mini-projects, and notes covering everything from **core Java fundamentals** to **advanced topics**.

I’m committed to building strong Java skills step-by-step and sharing my learning publicly to stay consistent and help others along the way.
